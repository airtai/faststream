abstract: >
  FastStream simplifies the process of writing producers and
  consumers for message queues, handling all the parsing,
  networking and documentation generation automatically.

  Making streaming microservices has never been easier.
  Designed with junior developers in mind, FastStream
  simplifies your work while keeping the door open for more
  advanced use cases. Here's a look at the core features
  that make FastStream a go-to framework for modern,
  data-centric microservices.

  - Multiple Brokers: FastStream provides a unified API to
  work across multiple message brokers (Apache Kafka,
  RabbitMQ, NATS and Redis support)

  - Pydantic Validation: Leverage Pydantic's validation
  capabilities to serialize and validate incoming messages

  - Automatic Docs: Stay ahead with automatic AsyncAPI
  documentation

  - Intuitive: Full-typed editor support makes your
  development experience smooth, catching errors before they
  reach runtime

  - Powerful Dependency Injection System: Manage your
  service dependencies efficiently with FastStream's
  built-in DI system

  - Testable: Supports in-memory tests, making your CI/CD
  pipeline faster and more reliable

  - Extensible: Use extensions for lifespans, custom
  serialization and middleware

  - Integrations: FastStream is fully compatible with any
  HTTP framework you want (FastAPI especially)
