# Publishing in Batches

## General Overview

If you need to send your data in batches, the `#!python @broker.publisher(...)` decorator offers a convenient way to achieve this. To enable batch production, you need to perform two crucial steps:

1. When creating your publisher, set the batch argument to `True`. This configuration tells the publisher that you intend to send messages in batches.

2. In your producer function, return a tuple containing the messages you want to send as a batch. This action triggers the producer to gather the messages and transmit them as a batch to a **Kafka** broker.

Let's delve into a detailed example illustrating how to produce messages in batches to the `#!python "output_data"` topic while consuming from the `#!python "input_data_1"` topic.

## Code Example

First, let's take a look at the whole app creation and then dive deep into the steps for producing in batches. Here is the application code:

```python linenums="1"
{!> docs_src/kafka/publish_batch/app.py!}
```

Below, we have highlighted key lines of code that demonstrate the steps involved in creating and using a batch publisher:

Step 1: Creation of the Publisher

```python linenums="1"
{!> docs_src/kafka/publish_batch/app.py [ln:19] !}
```

Step 2: Publishing an Actual Batch of Messages

You can publish a batch by directly calling the publisher with a batch of messages you want to publish, as shown here:

```python linenums="1"
{!> docs_src/kafka/publish_batch/app.py [ln:32-34] !}
```

Or you can decorate your processing function and return a batch of messages, as shown here:

```python linenums="1"
{!> docs_src/kafka/publish_batch/app.py [ln:22-26] !}
```

The application in the example imelements both of these ways, so feel free to use whichever option fits your needs better.

## Why Publish in Batches?

In the above example, we've explored how to leverage the `#!python @broker.publisher(...)` decorator to efficiently publish messages in batches using **FastStream** and **Kafka**. By following the two key steps outlined in the previous sections, you can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of your **Kafka**-based applications.

Publishing messages in batches offers several advantages when working with **Kafka**:

1. **Improved Throughput**: Batch publishing allows you to send multiple messages in a single transmission, reducing the overhead associated with individual message delivery. This leads to improved throughput and lower latency in your **Kafka** applications.

2. **Reduced Network and Broker Load**: Sending messages in batches reduces the number of network calls and broker interactions. This optimization minimizes the load on the **Kafka** brokers and network resources, making your **Kafka** cluster more efficient.

3. **Atomicity**: Batches ensure that a group of related messages is processed together or not at all. This atomicity can be crucial in scenarios where message processing needs to maintain data consistency and integrity.

4. **Enhanced Scalability**: With batch publishing, you can efficiently scale your **Kafka** applications to handle high message volumes. By sending messages in larger chunks, you can make the most of **Kafka**'s parallelism and partitioning capabilities.
