# Broker Publishing

The easiest way to publish a message is to use a Broker, which allows you to use it as a publisher client in any applications.

In the **FastStream** project, this call is not represented in the **AsyncAPI** scheme. You can use it to send rarely-publishing messages, such as startup or shutdown events.
