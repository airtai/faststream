# Prometheus

[**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/){.external-link target="_blank"} is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.
With a focus on reliability, robustness, and easy scalability, **Prometheus** allows users to collect metrics,
scrape data from various sources, store them efficiently, and query them in real-time. Its flexible data model,
powerful query language, and seamless integration with [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/){.external-link target="_blank"} make it a popular choice for monitoring the health
and performance of systems and applications.

### FastStream Metrics

To add a metrics to your broker, you need to:

1. Install `FastStream` with `prometheus-client`

    ```shell
    pip install faststream[prometheus]
    ```

2. Add `PrometheusMiddleware` to your broker

### Exposing the `/metrics` endpoint
The way Prometheus works requires the service to expose an HTTP endpoint for analysis.
By convention, this is a GET endpoint, and its path is usually `/metrics`.

FastStream's built-in **ASGI** support allows you to expose endpoints in your application.

A convenient way to serve this endpoint is to use `make_asgi_app` from `prometheus_client`,
passing in the registry that was passed to `PrometheusMiddleware`.

### Exported metrics

{% set received_messages_total_description = 'The metric is incremented each time the application receives a message.<br/><br/>This is necessary to count messages that the application has received but has not yet started processing.' %}
{% set received_messages_size_bytes_description = 'The metric is filled with the sizes of received messages.

{% set published_messages_duration_seconds_description = 'The metric is filled with the time the message was sent, regardless of whether the sending was successful or failed.<br/><br/>Timestamps are written immediately before and immediately after sending.<br/><br/>Then the metric is filled with their difference (in seconds).' %}
