### What's Changed

There were a lot of time since [**0.5.7 OpenTelemetry** release](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/releases/tag/0.5.7) and now we completed **Observability** features we planned! **FastStream** supports **Prometheus** metrics in a native way!

Special thanks to @roma-frolov and @draincoder (again) for it!

To collect **Prometheus** metrics for your **FastStream** application you just need to install special distribution

```cmd
pip install faststream[prometheus]
```

And use **PrometheusMiddleware**. Also, it could be helpful to use our [**ASGI**](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/asgi/) to serve metrics endpoint in the same app.

```python
from prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, make_asgi_app
from faststream.asgi import AsgiFastStream
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.nats.prometheus import NatsPrometheusMiddleware

registry = CollectorRegistry()

broker = NatsBroker(
    middlewares=(
        NatsPrometheusMiddleware(registry=registry),
    )
)

app = AsgiFastStream(
    broker,
    asgi_routes=[
        ("/metrics", make_asgi_app(registry)),
    ]
)
```

Moreover, we have a ready-to-use [**Grafana** dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/22130-faststream-metrics/) you can just import and use!

To find more information about **Prometheus** support, just visit [our documentation](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/prometheus/).

## 0.5.23

### What's Changed

We made last release just a few days ago, but there are some big changes here already!

1. First of all - you can't use `faststream run ...` command without `pip install faststream[cli]` distribution anymore. It was made to minify default (and production) distribution by removing **typer** (**rich** and **click**) dependencies. **CLI** is a development-time feature, so if you don't need - just don't install! Special thanks to @RubenRibGarcia for this change

2. The next big change - **Kafka** publish confirmations by default! Previous **FastStream** version was working in *publish & forgot* style, but the new one blocks your `broker.publish(...)` call until **Kafka** confirmation frame received. To fallback to previous logic just use a new flag `broker.publish(..., no_confirm=True)`

3. Also, we made one more step forward to our **1.0.0** features plan! @KrySeyt implements `get_one` feature. Now you can use any broker subscriber to get messages in imperative style:

```python
subscriber = broker.subscriber("in")
...
msg = await subscriber.get_one(timeout=5.0)
```

4. And the last one: @draincoder continues to develop OTEL support! Now he provides us with an ability to use **OTEL spans** and **baggage** in a comfortable **FastStream**-style. Just take a look at the [new documentation section](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/opentelemetry/#baggage)

Big thanks to all new and old contributors who makes such a great release!

## 0.5.19

### What's Changed

The current release is planned as a latest feature release before **0.6.0**. All other **0.5.19+** releases will contain only minor bugfixes and all the team work will be focused on next major one.

There's a lot of changes we want to present you now though!

#### New RPC feature

Our old `broker.publish(..., rpc=True)` implementation was very limited and ugly. Now we present you a much suitable way to do the same thing - `broker.request(...)`

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker, NatsResponse, NatsMessage

broker = NatsBroker()

@broker.subscriber("test")
async def echo_handler(msg):
    return NatsResponse(msg, headers={"x-token": "some-token"})

@app.after_startup
async def test():
    # The old implementation was returning just a message body,
    # so you wasn't be able to check response headers, etc
    msg_body: str = await broker.publish("ping", "test", rpc=True)
    assert msg_body == "ping"

    # Now request return the whole message and you can validate any part of it
    # moreover it triggers all your middlewares
    response: NatsMessage = await broker.request("ping", "test")
```

#### Exception Middleware

Community asked and community did! Sorry, we've been putting off this job for too long. Thanks for @Rusich90 to help us!
Now you can wrap your application by a suitable exception handlers. Just check the new [documentation](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/middlewares/exception/) to learn more.

#### Details

Also, there are a lot of minor changes you can find below. Big thanks to all our old and new contributors! You are amazing ones!

## 0.5.16

### What's Changed

Well, seems like it is the biggest patch release ever 😃

#### Detail Responses

First of all, thanks to all new contributors, who helps us to improve the project! They made a huge impact to this release by adding new Kafka security mechanisms and extend Response API - now you can use `broker.Response` to publish detail information from handler

```python
@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handler(msg):
    return Response(msg, headers={"response_header": "Hi!"})   # or KafkaResponse, etc
```

#### ASGI

Also, we added a new huge feature - [**ASGI** support](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/asgi/#other-asgi-compatibility)!

Nope, we are not HTTP-framework now, but it is a little ASGI implementation to provide you with an ability to host documentation, use k8s http-probes and serve metrics in the same with you broker runtime without any dependencies.

You just need to use **AsgiFastStream** class

```python
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.asgi import AsgiFastStream, make_ping_asgi

from prometheus_client import make_asgi_app
from prometheus_client.registry import CollectorRegistry

broker = NatsBroker()

prometheus_registry = CollectorRegistry()

app = AsgiFastStream(
    broker,
    asyncapi_path="/docs",
    asgi_routes=[
        ("/health", make_ping_asgi(broker, timeout=5.0)),
        ("/metrics", make_asgi_app(registry=prometheus_registry))
    ]
)
```

And then you can run it like a regular ASGI app

```shell
uvicorn main:app
```

#### Confluent partitions

One more thing - manual topic partition assignment for Confluent. We have it already for aiokafka, but missed it here... Now it was fixed!

```python
from faststream.confluent import TopicPartition

@broker.subscriber(partitions=[
    TopicPartition("test-topic", partition=0),
])
async def handler():
    ...
```

#### Detail changes

* feat: add RMQ `fail_fast` option in #1647

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/compare/0.5.15...0.5.16

## 0.5.15

### What's Changed

Finally, **FastStream** has a Kafka pattern subscription! This is another step forward in our [**Roadmap**](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/issues/1510) moving us to **0.6.0** and further!

```python
from faststream import Path
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker()

@broker.subscriber(pattern="logs.{level}")
async def base_handler(
    body: str,
    level: str = Path(),
):
    ...
```

Also, all brokers now supports a new `ping` method to check real broker connection

```python
is_connected: bool = await broker.ping()
```

This is a little, but important change for [K8S probes](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/issues/1181) support

More other there are a lot of bugfixes and improvements from our contributors! Thanks to all of these amazing people!

### What's Changed

Now, `FastStream` provides users with the ability to pass the `config` dictionary to `confluent-kafka-python` for greater customizability. The following example sets the parameter `topic.metadata.refresh.fast.interval.ms`'s value to `300` instead of the default value `100` via the `config` parameter.

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.confluent import KafkaBroker

config = {"topic.metadata.refresh.fast.interval.ms": 300}
broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092", config=config)
app = FastStream(broker)
```

## 0.5.8

### What's Changed

This is the time for a new **NATS** features! **FastStream** supports **NATS Key-Value** and **Object Storage** subscription features in a native way now (big thx for @sheldygg)!

1. KeyValue creation and watching API added (you can read updated [documentation section](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/nats/jetstream/key-value/) for changes):

   ```python
    from faststream import FastStream, Logger
    from faststream.nats import NatsBroker

    broker = NatsBroker()
    app = FastStream(broker)

    @broker.subscriber("some-key", kv_watch="bucket")
    async def handler(msg: int, logger: Logger):
        logger.info(msg)

    @app.after_startup
    async def test():
        kv = await broker.key_value("bucket")
        await kv.put("some-key", b"1")
   ```

2. ObjectStore API added as well (you can read updated [documentation section](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/nats/jetstream/object/) for changes):

    ```python
    from faststream import FastStream, Logger
    from faststream.nats import NatsBroker

    broker = NatsBroker()
    app = FastStream(broker)

    @broker.subscriber("file-bucket", obj_watch=True)
    async def handler(filename: str, logger: Logger):
        logger.info(filename)

    @app.after_startup
    async def test():
        object_store = await broker.object_storage("file-bucket")
        await object_store.put("some-file.txt", b"1")
    ```

3. Also now you can use just `pull_sub=True` instead of `pull_sub=PullSub()` in basic case:

   ```python
    from faststream import FastStream, Logger
    from faststream.nats import NatsBroker

    broker = NatsBroker()
    app = FastStream(broker)

    @broker.subscriber("test", stream="stream", pull_sub=True)
    async def handler(msg, logger: Logger):
        logger.info(msg)
    ```

Finally, we have a new feature, related to all brokers: special flag to suppress automatic RPC and reply_to responses:

```python
@broker.subscriber("tests", no_reply=True)
async def handler():
    ....

# will fail with timeout, because there is no automatic response
msg = await broker.publish("msg", "test", rpc=True)
```

* fix: when headers() returns None in AsyncConfluentParser, replace it with an empty tuple by @andreaimprovised in https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/pull/1460
* Implement Kv/Obj watch. by @sheldygg in https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/pull/1383

## 0.5.7

### What's Changed

Finally, FastStream supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in a native way to collect the full trace of your services! Big thanks for @draincoder for that!

First of all you need to install required dependencies to support OpenTelemetry:

```bash
pip install faststream[otel]
```

Then you can just add a middleware for your broker and that's it!

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
from faststream.nats.opentelemetry import NatsTelemetryMiddleware

broker = NatsBroker(
    middlewares=(
        NatsTelemetryMiddleware(),
    )
)
app = FastStream(broker)
```

To find detail information just visit our documentation about [telemetry](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/opentelemetry/)

P.S. The release includes basic OpenTelemetry support - messages tracing & basic metrics. Baggage support and correct spans linking in batch processing case will be added soon.

## 0.5.1

### What's Changed

We already have some fixes related to `RedisBroker` (#1375, #1376) and some new features for you:

1. Now `broke.include_router(...)` allows to pass some arguments to setup router at including moment instead of creation

  ```python
  broker.include_router(
     router,
     prefix="test_",
     dependencies=[Depends(...)],
     middlewares=[BrokerMiddleware],
     include_in_schema=False,
  )
  ```

2. `KafkaBroker().subscriber(...)` now consumes `aiokafka.ConsumerRebalanceListener` object.
You can find more information about it in the official [**aiokafka** doc](https://aiokafka.readthedocs.io/en/stable/consumer.html?highlight=subscribe#topic-subscription-by-pattern)

  (close #1319)

  ```python
  broker = KafkaBroker()

  broker.subscriber(..., listener=MyRebalancer())
  ```

`pattern` option was added too, but it is still experimental and does not support `Path`

3. [`Path`](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/nats/message/#subject-pattern-access) feature performance was increased. Also, `Path` is suitable for NATS `PullSub` batch subscription as well now.

```python
from faststream import NatsBroker, PullSub

broker = NastBroker()

@broker.subscriber(
    "logs.{level}",
    steam="test-stream",
    pull_sub=PullSub(batch=True),
)
async def base_handler(
    ...,
    level: str = Path(),
):
  ...
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/compare/0.5.0...0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### What's Changed

This is the biggest change since the creation of FastStream. We have completely refactored the entire package, changing the object registration mechanism, message processing pipeline, and application lifecycle. However, you won't even notice it—we've preserved all public APIs from breaking changes. The only feature not compatible with the previous code is the new middleware.

New features:

1. `await FastStream.stop()` method and `StopApplication` exception to stop a `FastStream` worker are added.

2. `broker.subscriber()` and `router.subscriber()` functions now return a `Subscriber` object you can use later.

```python
subscriber = broker.subscriber("test")

@subscriber(filter = lambda msg: msg.content_type == "application/json")
async def handler(msg: dict[str, Any]):
    ...

@subscriber()
async def handler(msg: dict[str, Any]):
    ...
 ```

This is the preferred syntax for [filtering](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/getting-started/subscription/filtering/) now (the old one will be removed in `0.6.0`)

 3. The `router.publisher()` function now returns the correct `Publisher` object you can use later (after broker startup).

 ```python
 publisher = router.publisher("test")

 @router.subscriber("in")
 async def handler():
     await publisher.publish("msg")
 ```

 (Until `0.5.0` you could use it in this way with `broker.publisher` only)

 4. A list of `middlewares` can be passed to a `broker.publisher` as well:

 ```python
 broker = Broker(..., middlewares=())

 @broker.subscriber(..., middlewares=())
 @broker.publisher(..., middlewares=())  # new feature
 async def handler():
     ...
 ```

5. Broker-level middlewares now affect all ways to publish a message, so you can encode application outgoing messages here.

6. ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE ⚠️ : both `subscriber` and `publisher` middlewares should be async context manager type

```python
async def subscriber_middleware(call_next, msg):
    return await call_next(msg)

async def publisher_middleware(call_next, msg, **kwargs):
    return await call_next(msg, **kwargs)

@broker.subscriber(
    "in",
    middlewares=(subscriber_middleware,),
)
@broker.publisher(
    "out",
    middlewares=(publisher_middleware,),
)
async def handler(msg):
    return msg
```

Such changes allow you two previously unavailable features:
* suppress any exceptions and pass fall-back message body to publishers, and
* patch any outgoing message headers and other parameters.

Without those features we could not implement [Observability Middleware](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/issues/916) or any similar tool, so it is the job that just had to be done.
7. A better **FastAPI** compatibility: `fastapi.BackgroundTasks` and `response_class` subscriber option are supported.

8. All `.pyi` files are removed, and explicit docstrings and methods options are added.

9. New subscribers can be registered in runtime (with an already-started broker):

```python
subscriber = broker.subscriber("dynamic")
subscriber(handler_method)
...
broker.setup_subscriber(subscriber)
await subscriber.start()
...
await subscriber.close()
```

10. `faststream[docs]` distribution is removed.

## 0.5.0rc2

### What's Changed

This is the final API change before stable `0.5.0` release

⚠️ HAS BREAKING CHANGE

In it, we stabilize the behavior of publishers & subscribers middlewares

```python
async def subscriber_middleware(call_next, msg):
    return await call_next(msg)

async def publisher_middleware(call_next, msg, **kwargs):
    return await call_next(msg, **kwargs)

@broker.subscriber(
    "in",
    middlewares=(subscriber_middleware,),
)
@broker.publisher(
    "out",
    middlewares=(publisher_middleware,),
)
async def handler(msg):
    return msg
```

Such changes allows you two features previously unavailable

* suppress any exceptions and pas fall-back message body to publishers
* patch any outgoing message headers and other parameters

Without these features we just can't implement [Observability Middleware](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/issues/916) or any similar tool, so it is the job to be done.

Now you are free to get access at any message processing stage and we are one step closer to the framework we would like to create!

However, you won't even notice it—we've preserved all public APIs from breaking changes. The only feature not compatible with the previous code is the new middleware.

This is still an RC (Release Candidate) for you to test before the stable release. You can manually install it in your project:

```console
pip install faststream==0.5.0rc0
```

We look forward to your feedback!

New features:

1. `await FastStream.stop()` method and `StopApplication` exception to stop a `FastStream` worker are added.

2. `broker.subscriber()` and `router.subscriber()` functions now return a `Subscriber` object you can use later.

## 0.4.0

### What's Changed

This release adds support for the [Confluent's Python Client for Apache Kafka (TM)](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python). Confluent's Python Client for Apache Kafka does not support natively `async` functions and its integration with modern async-based services is a bit trickier. That was the reason why our initial supported by Kafka broker used [aiokafka](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiokafka). However, that choice was a less fortunate one as it is as well maintained as the Confluent version. After receiving numerous requests, we finally decided to bite the bullet and create an `async` wrapper around Confluent's Python Client and add full support for it in FastStream.

If you want to try it out, install it first with:
```sh
pip install "faststream[confluent]>=0.4.0"
```

To connect to Kafka using the FastStream KafkaBroker module, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the KafkaBroker instance: Start by initializing a KafkaBroker instance with the necessary configuration, including Kafka broker address.

2. Create your processing logic: Write a function that will consume the incoming messages in the defined format and produce a response to the defined topic

3. Decorate your processing function: To connect your processing function to the desired Kafka topics you need to decorate it with `@broker.subscriber(...)` and `@broker.publisher(...)` decorators. Now, after you start your application, your processing function will be called whenever a new message in the subscribed topic is available and produce the function return value to the topic defined in the publisher decorator.

Here's a simplified code example demonstrating how to establish a connection to Kafka using FastStream's KafkaBroker module:

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.confluent import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber("in-topic")
@broker.publisher("out-topic")
async def handle_msg(user: str, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"User: {user_id} - {user} registered"
```

### What's Changed

NATS concurrent subscriber:

By default,  NATS subscriber consumes messages with a block per subject. So, you can't process multiple messages from the same subject at the same time. But, with the `broker.subscriber(..., max_workers=...)` option, you can! It creates an async tasks pool to consume multiple messages from the same subject and allows you to process them concurrently!

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.nats import NatsBroker

broker = NatsBroker()
app = FastStream()

@broker.subscriber("test-subject", max_workers=10)
async def handler(...):
   """Can process up to 10 messages in the same time."""
```

The main feature of the 0.3.0 release is added Redis support by [@Lancetnik](https://github.com/Lancetnik){.external-link target="_blank"} in [#1003](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/pull/1003){.external-link target="_blank"}

You can install it by the following command:

```bash
pip install "faststream[redis]"
```

Here is a little code example

```python
from faststream import FastStream, Logger
from faststream.redis import RedisBroker

broker = RedisBroker()
app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber(
    channel="test",  # or
    # list="test",     or
    # stream="test",
)
async def handle(msg: str, logger: Logger):
    logger.info(msg)
```

## 0.2.10

### What's Changed

Now, you can hide your connection secrets in the **AsyncAPI** schema by manually setting up the server URL:

```python
broker = RabbitBroker(
    "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/",  # Connection URL
    asyncapi_url="amqp://****:****@localhost:5672/",  # Public schema URL
)
```

Additionally, the **RabbitMQ AsyncAPI** schema has been improved, adding support for `faststream.security`, and the connection scheme is now defined automatically.

**RabbitMQ** connection parameters are now merged, allowing you to define the main connection data as a URL string and customize it using kwargs:

```python
broker = RabbitBroker(
    "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/",
    host="127.0.0.1",
)

# amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/ - The final URL
```

## 0.2.4

### New Functionalities

Now, `Context` provides access to inner [dict keys too](./getting-started/context/fields.md):

```python
# headers is a `dict`
async def handler(
  user_id: int = Context("message.headers.user_id", cast=True),
): ...
```

Added `Header` object as a shortcut to `#!python Context("message.headers.")` inner fields (**NATS** [example](./nats/message.md#headers-access)):

```python
# the same with the previous example
async def handler(
  user_id: int = Header(),
  u_id: int = Header("user_id"),  # with custom name
): ...
```

Added `Path` object to get access to [**NATS** wildcard](./nats/message.md#subject-pattern-access) subject or [**RabbitMQ** topic](./rabbit/message.md#topic-pattern-access) routing key (a shortcut to access `#!python Context("message.path.")` as well):

```python
@nats_broker.subscriber("logs.{level}")
async def handler(
  level: str = Path(),
)
```

Also, the original message `Context` annotation was copied from `faststream.[broker].annotations.[Broker]Message` to `faststream.[broker].[Broker]Message` to provide you with faster access to the most commonly used object (**NATS** [example](./nats/message.md#message-access)).

**Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/commits/0.1.1](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/commits/0.1.1){.external-link target="_blank"}

## 0.1.0

**FastStream** is a new package based on the ideas and experiences gained from [FastKafka](https://github.com/airtai/fastkafka){.external-link target="_blank"} and [Propan](https://github.com/lancetnik/propan){.external-link target="_blank"}. By joining our forces, we picked up the best from both packages and created the unified way to write services capable of processing streamed data regardless of the underlying protocol. We'll continue to maintain both packages, but new development will be in this project. If you are starting a new service, this package is the recommended way to do it.

### Features

[**FastStream**](https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/) simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for message queues, handling all the
parsing, networking and documentation generation automatically.

Making streaming microservices has never been easier. Designed with junior developers in mind, **FastStream** simplifies your work while keeping the door open for more advanced use-cases. Here's a look at the core features that make **FastStream** a go-to framework for modern, data-centric microservices.

* **Multiple Brokers**: **FastStream** provides a unified API to work across multiple message brokers (**Kafka**, **RabbitMQ** support)

* [**Pydantic Validation**](./faststream.md/#writing-app-code): Leverage [**Pydantic's**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/){.external-link target="_blank"} validation capabilities to serialize and validates incoming messages

* [**Automatic Docs**](./faststream.md/#project-documentation): Stay ahead with automatic [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/){.external-link target="_blank"} documentation.

* **Intuitive**: full typed editor support makes your development experience smooth, catching errors before they reach runtime

* [**Powerful Dependency Injection System**](./faststream.md/#dependencies): Manage your service dependencies efficiently with **FastStream**'s built-in DI system.

* [**Testable**](./faststream.md/#testing-the-service): supports in-memory tests, making your CI/CD pipeline faster and more reliable

* **Extendable**: use extensions for lifespans, custom serialization and middlewares

* [**Integrations**](./faststream.md/#any-framework): **FastStream** is fully compatible with any HTTP framework you want ([**FastAPI**](./faststream.md/#fastapi-plugin) especially)

* **Built for Automatic Code Generation**: **FastStream** is optimized for automatic code generation using advanced models like GPT and Llama

That's **FastStream** in a nutshell—easy, efficient, and powerful. Whether you're just starting with streaming microservices or looking to scale, **FastStream** has got you covered.
