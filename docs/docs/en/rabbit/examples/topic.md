# Topic Exchange

The **Topic** Exchange is a powerful *RabbitMQ* routing tool. This type of `exchange` sends messages to the queue in accordance with the *pattern* specified when they are connected to `exchange` and the `routing_key` of the message itself.

At the same time, if several consumers are subscribed to the queue, messages will be distributed among them.

## Example

```python linenums="1"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py !}
```

### Consumer Announcement

First, we announce our **Topic** exchange and several queues that will listen to it:

```python linenums="7" hl_lines="1 3-4"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py [ln:7-10]!}
```

At the same time, in the `routing_key` of our queues, we specify the *pattern* of routing keys that will be processed by this queue.

Then we sign up several consumers using the advertised queues to the `exchange` we created:

```python linenums="13" hl_lines="1 6 11"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py [ln:13-25]!}
```

!!! note
    `handler1` and `handler2` are subscribed to the same `exchange` using the same queue:
    within a single service, this does not make sense, since messages will come to these handlers in turn.
    Here we emulate the work of several consumers and load balancing between them.

### Message Distribution

Now the distribution of messages between these consumers will look like this:

```python linenums="30"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py [ln:30]!}
```

Message `1` will be sent to `handler1` because it listens to `exchange` using a queue with the routing key `*.info`.

---

```python linenums="31"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py [ln:31]!}
```

Message `2` will be sent to `handler2` because it listens to `exchange` using the same queue, but `handler1` is busy.

---

```python linenums="32"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py [ln:32]!}
```

Message `3` will be sent to `handler1` again because it is currently free.

---

```python linenums="33"
{!> docs_src/rabbit/subscription/topic.py [ln:33]!}
```

Message `4` will be sent to `handler3` because it is the only one listening to `exchange` using a queue with the routing key `*.debug`.
