# Redis Broker

## Redis Overview

### What is Redis?

[Redis](https://redis.io/){.external-link target="_blank"} is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries. **Redis** has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via **Redis Sentinel** and automatic partitioning with **Redis Cluster**.

### Key Redis Concepts

**Redis** is not just a key-value store; it is a data structures server, supporting different kinds of values. This makes **Redis** flexible and suitable for a wide range of problems. It offers versatile approaches for message handling through **Pub/Sub**, **List**, and **Stream** structures.

#### 1. Pub/Sub

[**Redis Pub/Sub**](https://redis.io/docs/interact/pubsub/){.external-link target="_blank"} implements the Publish/Subscribe messaging paradigm where senders (publishers) are not programmed to send their messages to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, published messages are characterized into channels, without knowledge of what (if any) subscribers there may be.

#### 2. List

In contrast, [**Redis List**](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists/#common-use-cases-for-lists){.external-link target="_blank"} capitalizes on a straightforward list data structure. Messages, pushed by producers, form a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue. Consumers, in turn, retrieve messages from this ordered list, providing a simplified mechanism for sequential message processing.

#### 3. Streams

[**Redis Streams**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/){.external-link target="_blank"} introduce a more advanced concept, embracing an append-only log-like structure. Messages, organized as entries, allow for nuanced features like consumer groups, enabling parallel processing, and acknowledgment for precise message handling. Streams excel in scenarios demanding scalability, persistence, and ordered message processing.

Ultimately, the choice between **Pub/Sub**, **List**, or **Streams** hinges on the specific needs of the application. Redis Pub/Sub suits real-time communication, List offers simplicity in ordered processing, while Streams cater to complex, scalable, and ordered message handling, each providing tailored solutions based on distinct use case requirements.

## Redis in FastStream

### FastStream RedisBroker

The **FastStream** `RedisBroker` is a key component of the **FastStream** framework that enables seamless integration with **Redis**. With the `RedisBroker`, developers can easily connect to **Redis** instances, publish messages to **Redis** channels, and subscribe to **Redis** channels within their **FastStream** applications.

### Establishing a Connection

To connect to **Redis** using the **FastStream** `RedisBroker` module, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the RedisBroker instance:** Start by initializing a `RedisBroker` instance with the necessary configuration, including **Redis** server address and port.

2. **Create your processing logic:** Write a function that will consume the incoming messages from the subscribed channel and optionally publish a response to another channel.

3. **Decorate your processing function:** To connect your processing function to the desired **Redis** channels, you need to decorate it with `#!python @broker.subscriber(...)` and `#!python @broker.publisher(...)` decorators. Now, after you start your application, your processing function will be called whenever a new message in the subscribed channel is available and produce the function return value to the channel defined in the publisher decorator.

Here's a simplified code example demonstrating how to establish a connection to **Redis** using **FastStream**'s `RedisBroker` module:

```python linenums="1"
{! docs_src/index/redis/basic.py!}
```

This minimal example illustrates how **FastStream** simplifies the process of connecting to **Redis** and performing basic message processing from the *in-channel* to the *out-channel*. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you can further customize your **Redis** integration with **FastStream** to build efficient and responsive applications.

For more advanced configuration options and detailed usage instructions, please refer to the **FastStream Redis** documentation and the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation){.external-link target="_blank"}.
