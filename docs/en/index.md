------------------------------------------------------------------------

[FastStream](fastkafka.airt.ai) is a powerful and easy-to-use Python
library for building asynchronous services that interact with Event streams
topics. Built on top of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) and
[AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), FastStream simplifies the process
of writing producers and consumers for Message Queues, handling all the
parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically.
With FastStream, you can quickly prototype and develop high-performance
Event-based services with minimal code, making it an ideal choice for
developers looking to streamline their workflow and accelerate their
projects.

## Install

FastStream works on macOS, Linux, and most Unix-style operating systems.
You can install it with `pip` as usual:

``` sh
pip install faststream
```

## Writing server code

Here is an example python app using FastStream that consumes data from a 
topic, increments the value, and outputs the data to another topic.

``` python
{!> ../../docs_src/kafka/base_example/app.py!}
```

### Messages

FastStream uses [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) to parse input
JSON-encoded data into Python objects, making it easy to work with
structured data in your Kafka-based applications. Pydantic’s
[`BaseModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models/) class allows you
to define messages using a declarative syntax, making it easy to specify
the fields and types of your messages.

This example defines one message class for use in a FastStream
application, `Data`.

``` python hl_lines="1 6-9"
{!> ../../docs_src/kafka/base_example/app.py!}
```

These message class will be used to parse and validate incoming data
when consuming and to produce a JSON-encoded message when producing.
Using Pydantic’s BaseModel in combination with FastStream makes it easy
to work with structured data in your Event-based applications.

### Application

This example shows how to initialize a FastStream application.

It starts by initialising a `Broker` object with the address of the Message broker.

Next, an object of the `FastStream` class is created and a `Broker` object is passed to it.

``` python hl_lines="3 4 11 12"
{!> ../../docs_src/kafka/base_example/app.py!}
```

### Function decorators

FastStream brokers provide convenient function decorators `broker.subscriber`
and `@broker.publisher` to allow you to delegate the actual process of

- consuming and producing data to Event queues, and

- decoding and encoding JSON encoded messages

from user defined functions to the framework. The FastStream framework
delegates these jobs to AIOKafka and Pydantic libraries.

These decorators make it easy to specify the processing logic for your
consumers and producers, allowing you to focus on the core
business logic of your application without worrying about the underlying
integration.

This following example shows how to use the `@broker.subscriber` and
`@broker.publisher` decorators in a FastKafka application:

- The `@broker.subscriber` decorator is applied to the `on_input_data`
  function, which specifies that this function should be called whenever
  a message is received on the “input_data” Kafka topic. The
  `on_input_data` function takes a single argument which is expected to
  be an instance of the `Data` message class. Specifying the type
  of the single argument is instructing the Pydantic to use
  `InputData.parse_raw()` on the consumed message before passing it to
  the user defined function `on_input_data`.

- The `@broker.publisher` decorator is applied also to the `on_input_data` function,
  which specifies that this function should produce a message to the
  “output_data” topic whenever it is called. The `on_input_data`
  function takes the input data and creates a new
  `Data` message with incremented value and then returns it. The
  framework will call the `Data.json().encode("utf-8")` function
  on the returned value and produce it to the specified topic.

``` python hl_lines="14-18"
