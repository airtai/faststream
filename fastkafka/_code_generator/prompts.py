DEFAULT_FASTKAFKA_PROMPT = '''
FastKafka is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of Pydantic, AIOKafka and AsyncAPI, FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. 

Every FastKafka application must consists the following components:

  - Messages
  - Application
  - Function decorators

Messages:

In FastKafka, messages represent the data that users publish or consume from specific Kafka topic. The structure of these messages is defined using Pydantic, which simplifies the process of specifying fields and their data types. FastKafka utilizes Pydantic to seamlessly parse JSON-encoded data into Python objects, enabling easy handling of structured data in Kafka-based applications.

Example: Here's an example of a message for a simple use case:

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat


class StoreProduct(BaseModel):
    product_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the product")
    currency: str = Field(..., description="Currency")
    price: NonNegativeFloat = Field(..., description="Price of the product")
```

In the provided example, the "StoreProduct" message class is inherited from Pydantic's BaseModel class and includes three fields: "product_name," "currency," and "price." Pydantic's "Field" function is used to specify the properties of each field, including their data types and descriptions.

Application:

We can create a new application object by initialising the FastKafka class with the minimum set of arguments. Below is the function declaration of the FastKafka constructor:

```python
class FastKafka:
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        title: Optional[str] = None,
        description: Optional[str] = None,
        version: Optional[str] = None,
        contact: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        kafka_brokers: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        root_path: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None,
        lifespan: Optional[Callable[["FastKafka"], AsyncContextManager[None]]] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        """Creates FastKafka application

                the title will be set to empty string
            description: optional description for the documentation. If
                None, the description will be set to empty string

                manager, e.g.:`async with kafka_app...`

        """
        pass
```

Example: Creating a new FastKafka app by passing the minimum set of arguments. In this case "kafka_brokers".

```python
from fastkafka import FastKafka

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)
```
In the provided example, the kafka_brokers is a dictionary containing entries for local development and production Kafka brokers. These entries specify the URL, port, and other broker details, which are used for both generating documentation and running the server against the specified Kafka broker.

Function decorators in FastKafka:

FastKafka provides two convenient decorator functions: @kafka_app.consumes and @kafka_app.produces. These decorators are used for consuming and producing data to and from Kafka topics. They also handle the decoding and encoding of JSON-encoded messages.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use the @kafka_app.consumes decorator to consume messages from Kafka topics.

Example: Consuming messages from a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a Kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="hello_world")
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    print(f"Got msg: {msg.name}")
```
In the provided example, the @kafka_app.consumes decorator is applied to the on_hello_world function, indicating that this function should be called whenever a message is received on the "hello_world" Kafka topic. The on_hello_world function takes a single argument, which is expected to be an instance of the HelloWorld message class. When a message is received, the function prints the name field from the message.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use @kafka_app.produces decorator to produce messages to Kafka topics.

Example: Producing messages to a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.produces(topic="hello_world")
async def to_hello_world(name: str) -> HelloWorld:
    return HelloWorld(name=name)
```

In this example, the @kafka_app.produces decorator is applied to the to_hello_world function. This decorator indicates that calling the to_hello_world function not only returns an instance of the HelloWorld class but also sends the return value to the "hello_world" Kafka topic.

Below is a comprehensive code example for producing and consuming data using FastKafka. We will create a basic FastKafka application that consumes data from the "input_data" topic, logs the data using a logger, and then produces the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat

from fastkafka import FastKafka
from fastkafka._components.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

class Data(BaseModel):
    data: NonNegativeFloat = Field(
        ..., example=0.5, description="Float data example"
    )

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="input_data", auto_offset_reset="latest")
async def on_input_data(msg: Data):
    logger.info(f"Got data: {msg.data}")
    await to_output_data(msg.data)


@kafka_app.produces(topic="output_data")
async def to_output_data(data: float) -> Data:
    processed_data = Data(data=data+1.0)
    return processed_data
```
In the given code, we create a FastKafka application using the FastKafka() constructor with the title and the kafka_brokers arguments.We define the Data message class using Pydantic to represent the data with an integer value. The application is configured to consume messages from the "input_data" topic, log the data using a logger named "data_logger," and then produce the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

Using this code, messages can be processed end-to-end, allowing you to consume data, perform operations, and produce the result back to another Kafka topic with ease.

Instructions you must follow while generating plan:

- The plan must include AT LEAST one app and one entity.
- The entities should never be set to []. Pay close attention to the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section and generate an appropriate entity.
- The app_name should be in lower letters and can have "underscore".
- Both "entities" and "apps" can't be empty lists. Each entity in the "entities" list should have a "name" and "arguments" specified in JSON format. The "arguments" should be defined as key-value pairs where the keys represent the argument names, and the values represent the argument types.
- All classes and enums described in the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section should be included in the "entities" list.
- In the apps, the "kafka_brokers" attribute should only include explicitly defined brokers from the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section. If no kafka brokers are defined, set the "kafka_brokers" attribute in apps to "null".
- Consume function names should follow the format: prefix + "_" + topic name. If the user doesn't explicitly define the prefix for the consumes function, the default prefix "on" should be used.
- Produce function names should follow the format: prefix + "_" + topic name. If the user doesn't explicitly define the prefix for the produces function, the default prefix "to" should be used.
- Every consumes function in the "consumes_functions" must have the following attributes defined: "topic", "prefix,", "parameters" and "description".
- Every produces function in the "produces_functions" must have the following attributes defined: "topic", "prefix", "parameters", "description", and "return".
- You have a habit of missing out "returns" in "produces_functions". Remember each function in "produces_functions" must have the "return" key defined, and it SHOULD NOT never be set to "None" or missed out from the dictionary. Pay close attention to the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section and generate an appropriate return.
- The attributes "parameters" and "returns" of the consumes function and produces function cannot be primitive types (e.g., str, int, float, bool). They must inherit from a data model like Pydantic BaseModel.
- The "parameters" of the consumes function and produces function cannot be an empty list.
- ALWAYS name the first parameter of the consume function as "msg".
- The "description" parameter of the produces and consumes function should be very detailed and include step by step instructions which can be used to implement the business logic without any confusions. Pay close attention to the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section and generate the description. 
- You should always start the "description" parameter of the produces and consumes function like "This function" and should never use "Implement the business logic to " in your response. Instead write detailed business logic as instructions.

Please respond with a valid JSON plan only. No other text should be included in the response.

Strictly follow the below steps while generating the Python script

==== Step by Step instruction: ==== 

We are implementing a FastKafka app (check above for description).

This app has the following Message classes:
- User

Let's now implement the Employee message class with the following arguments:

Argument: name, Type: str

Now, lets create a instance of the FastKafka app with the following fields and assign it to the variable named "producer_app":

kafka_brokers: None
title: Producer Kafka app


Now lets write the following @producer_app.produces functions with the following details:

- write a produces function named "to_first" which should produce messages to the "first" topic and set the prefix parameter to "to".
- The function should take the following parameters:
  - Parameter: user, Type: User
- The function should implement the following business logic:
  - This function creates a User object and sends it to the 'first' Kafka topic. The function accepts a User object as input. It then returns the same User object which gets automatically sent to the 'first' topic by the FastKafka framework
- After implementing the above logic, the function should return the User object.


Now lets write the following @producer_app.produces functions with the following details:

- write a produces function named "to_second" which should produce messages to the "second" topic and set the prefix parameter to "to".
- The function should take the following parameters:
  - Parameter: user, Type: User
- The function should implement the following business logic:
  - This function creates a User object and sends it to the 'second' Kafka topic. The function accepts a User object as input. It then returns the same User object which gets automatically sent to the 'second' topic by the FastKafka framework.
- After implementing the above logic, the function should return the User object.


=====

Now, lets create a instance of the FastKafka app with the following fields and assign it to the variable named "consumer_app":

kafka_brokers: None
title: Consumer Kafka app


Now lets write the following @consumer_app.consumes functions with the following details:

- write a consume function named "on_first" which should consume messages from the "first" topic and set the prefix parameter to "on".
- The function should take the following parameters:
  - Parameter: msg, Type: User
- The function should implement the following business logic:
  - This function consumes a User object from the 'first' Kafka topic. The function accepts a User object as input. It then simply prints the name attribute of the User object to the console.  


Now lets write the following @consumer_app.consumes functions with the following details:

- write a consume function named "on_second" which should consume messages from the "second" topic and set the prefix parameter to "on".
- The function should take the following parameters:
  - Parameter: msg, Type: User
- The function should implement the following business logic:
  - This function consumes a User object from the 'second' Kafka topic. The function accepts a User object as input. It then simply prints the name attribute of the User object to the console.




==== Additional strong guidelines for you to follow: ==== 

- You should strictly follow the above steps and generate code only for the things mentioned in ==== Step by Step instruction: ==== section.
- Never import unnecessary libraries.
- Import all the necessary libraries at the beginning of the script.
- You SHOULD always import all the symbols from the typing module and that should be your first import statement.
- DO NOT enclose the Python script within backticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response 
- The response should be an executable Python script only, with no additional text.
- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). 
- Don't ever put "pass" or "#TODO" comments in the implementation. Instead, always write real implementation!

Please refer to the below ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== for additional implementation details: 

==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====
Generate two fastkafka apps, the first fastkafka apps should contain two produces functions. It should send a User object with name attribute to "first" and "second" topic. The second fastkafka app should consume the data from the topics "first" and "second" and print in.

TEST_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''
Testing FastKafka apps:
In order to speed up development and make testing easier, we have implemented the Tester class.
The Tester instance starts in-memory implementation of Kafka broker i.e. there is no need for starting localhost Kafka service for testing FastKafka apps. The Tester will redirect consumes and produces decorated functions to the in-memory Kafka broker so that you can quickly test FasKafka apps without the need of a running Kafka broker and all its dependencies. Also, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented, the Tester will create the produces function (and the other way - if the produces function is implemented, Tester will create consumes function).

Basic example:
To showcase the functionalities of FastKafka and illustrate the concepts discussed, we can use a simple test message called TestMsg. Here's the definition of the TestMsg class:

"""
class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)
"""

In this example we have implemented FastKafka app with one consumes and one produces function. on_input function consumes messages from the input topic and to_output function produces messages to the output topic.

Testing the application:
Tester is using async code so it needs to be written inside async function.
In this example app has imlemented on_input and to_output functions. We can now use Tester to create their mirrored functions: to_input and on_output.

tester produces the message to the input topic
Assert that the app consumed the message by calling on_input with the accurate argument
Within on_input function, to_output function is called - and message is produced to the output topic
Assert that the tester consumed the message by calling on_output with the accurate argument

============
At the beginnig of testing script import application which is located at the application.py file. The implementation of application.py is described in the "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ====" section.
Do not implement again application.py, just import it and use it's elements for test writing!
Also import asyncio and Tester:
"""
from fastkafka.testing import Tester
import asyncio
"""
implement async test function which uses Tester for the testing of the FastKafka apps in the "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ==== " section

While testing, crate an new message object each time you assert some statement (don't reuse the same object)!

Additional strong guidelines for you to follow:
- if app has a conusme on_topic function, app can check if the function was called wit the right parameters:
"""
await app.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""

- if app has a conusme on_topic function, tester can produce message to that topic:  await tester.to_topic(msg)
- if app has a produces to_topic function, app can produce message to that topic:  await app.to_topic(msg)
- if app has a produces to_topic function, tester can consume message from that topic and check if it was called with the correct arguments:
"""
await tester.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""

Rules:
- if app has a conusme on_topic function, tester CAN NOT consume message from that topic and check if it was called with the correct arguments:: 
"""
await tester.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""
- if app has a produces to_topic function, tester CAN NOT produce message to that topic:  await tester.to_topic(msg)

Add to the end of the python sctipt async test function and within it use Tester class for testing this app
The response should be an executable Python script only, with no additional text!!!!!

==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====
Create FastKafka application which consumes messages from the store_product topic, it consumes messages with three attributes: product_name, currency and price. While consuming, it should produce a message to the change_currency topic. input parameters for this producing function should be store_product object and function should store_product. produces function should check if the currency in the input store_product parameter is "HRK", currency should be set to "EUR" and the price should be divided with 7.5.
