              replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the
              record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica
              remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.

                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the

                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an

                should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value
                as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset`
                in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values,
                they will be excluded from the response.

                When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.

                This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset`
                and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of

                when it makes sense.
