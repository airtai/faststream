Develop a FastStream application using localhost kafka broker.
The app should consume messages from the input_data topic.
The input message is a JSON encoded object including two attributes:
    - x: float
    - y: float

input_data topic should use partition key.
While consuming the message, increment x and y attributes by 1 and publish that message to the output_data topic.
The same partition key should be used in the input_data and output_data topic.
