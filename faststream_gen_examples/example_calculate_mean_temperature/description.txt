Create faststream application for consuming messages from the weather topic.
This topic needs to use partition key.

weather messages use JSON with two attributes:
    - temperature (type float)
    - windspeed (type float)

Application should save each message to a dictionary (global variable) - partition key should be usded as a dictionary key and value should be a List of temperatures.
Calculate the temperature mean of the last 5 messages for the given partition key
Publish the temperature price mean to the temperature_mean topic and use the same partition key which the weather topic is using.
