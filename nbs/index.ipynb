    "FastKafkaAPI is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous web services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic, and AIOKafka, FastKafkaAPI simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, and task scheduling automatically. With FastKafkaAPI, you can quickly prototype and develop high-performance Kafka-based services with minimal code, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to streamline their workflow and accelerate their projects."

    "After running this command, you will be able to import and use the FastKafkaAPI package in your Python code. For example, you might use it to initialize a FastKafkaAPI application, as shown in the example bellow, and to use the `@consumes` and `@produces` decorators to define Kafka consumers and producers in your application.\n",
