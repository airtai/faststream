Built on top of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [AIOKafka](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiokafka) and [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. With FastKafka, you can quickly prototype and develop high-performance Kafka-based services with minimal code, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to streamline their workflow and accelerate their projects.\n",

    "- The `@kafka_app.consumes` decorator is applied to the `on_input_data` function, which specifies that this function should be called whenever a message is received on the \"input_data\" Kafka topic. The `on_input_data` function takes a single argument which is expected to be an instance of the `Data` message class. Specifying the type of the single argument is instructing the Pydantic to use `Data.parse_raw()` on the consumed message before passing it to the user defined function `on_input_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `@produces` decorator is applied to the `to_output_data` function, which specifies that this function should produce a message to the \"output_data\" Kafka topic whenever it is called. The `to_output_data` function takes a single float argument `data`. It it increments the data returns it wrapped in a `Data` object. The framework will call the `Data.json().encode(\"utf-8\")` function on the returned value and produce it to the specified topic."
